### Setting up machines 
We will be helping people set up machines to do Data Science. Before the workshop, please download [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for Windows, Mac, or Linux, as the download will likely take a while. 
- For ALL: We will be using Python 3.6, so get the Python 3.6 installer
- For Windows & Linux: Unless you are using a rather old PC, you should download the 64bit installer. If your pc is low-power or old, and you are unsure if you have a 64bit system, use this reference to check.
- For MacOS: Both the graphical or the commandline install is fine. Choose either based off your preference.
- For ChromeBooks: This will have to be done on a case by case basis. We recommend not to bring in a chromebook, but for many models Anaconda and jupyter notebooks can be installed.

If for some reason your anaconda installation doesn't fully work, please show it to us in person so that we can help you resolve it. There are some bugs with the graphical anaconda manager, but there are some very easy work arounds that we can show you if they don't work.

In a nutshell:
You can run: 
```
jupyter notebook
```
from the terminal(MacOS/Linux) or cmd(Windows), and you will open up the jupyter notebook in your default browser.
