Here is a link some of the wonderful slides that Jimmy has prepared. We will be playing by ear and going through the material at an optimized pace.

Here is our itinerary:
Setting up machines: We will be helping people set up machines to do Data Science. Before the workshop, please download Anaconda for Windows, Mac, or Linux, as the download will likely take a while. 
For ALL: We will be using Python 3.6, so get the Python 3.6 installer
For Windows & Linux: Unless you are using a rather old PC, you should download the 64bit installer. If your pc is low-power or old, and you are unsure if you have a 64bit system, use this reference to check.
For MacOS: Both the graphical or the commandline install is fine. Choose either based off your preference.
For ChromeBooks: This will have to be done on a case by case basis. We recommend not to bring in a chromebook, but for many models Anaconda and jupyter notebooks can be installed.

Workshop: We will jumping into the foundations of Python and Data Science. And we will also have a segment of some cool stuff you can do will the tools we will be teaching you such as applications, statistics, NLP, classification, machine learning, geospatial modeling, and the like. This will be a really quick taste of what you can do once you really dig your heels into Data Science and Python.
Afterwards: Would love to chat about data science, finish setting up machines, and help people in anyway we can!
