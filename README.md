### Learn Data Science in Python
by Jimmy Lin
(with a tiny amount of stuff by Jeffery Do)

This is a Data Science Workshop which is hosted by the 
Cal Poly Data Science Club.

The goal of this workshop is to help students build up the foundation
required to get started with data science on their own.

Feel free to look at our slides or open our jupyter notebooks.
